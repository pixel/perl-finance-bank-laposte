     my @accounts = Finance::Bank::LaPoste->check_balance(
        username => "0120123456L",  # your main account is something like 
                                    # 0123456 L 012, stick it together with the region first

     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a read-only interface to the Videoposte online
    banking system at <https://www.videoposte.com/>. You will need either
    Crypt::SSLeay installed.

    The interface of this module is similar to other Finance::Bank::*
    modules.

WARNING
    This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that
    means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source
    of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me,
    but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.

METHODS
  new(username => "0120123456L", password => "123456", feedback => sub { warn "Finance::Bank::LaPoste: $_[0]\n" })
    Return an object . You can optionally provide to this method a
    LWP::UserAgent object (argument named "ua"). You can also provide a
    function used for feedback (useful for verbose mode or debugging)
    (argument named "feedback")

  check_balance(username => "0120123456L", password => "123456")
    Return a list of account (F::B::LaPoste::Account) objects, one for each
    of your bank accounts.

Account methods
  sort_code()
    Return the sort code of the account. Currently, it returns an undefined
    value.

  name()
    Returns the human-readable name of the account.

  account_no()
    Return the account number, in the form "XXXXXXXXX YY", where X and Y are
    numbers.

  balance()
    Returns the balance of the account.

  statements()
    Return a list of Statement object (Finance::Bank::LaPoste::Statement).

  currency()
    Returns the currency of the account as a three letter ISO code (EUR,
    CHF, etc.)

Statement methods
  date()
    Returns the date when the statement occured, in DD/MM/YY format.

  description()
    Returns a brief description of the statement.

  amount()
    Returns the amount of the statement (expressed in Euros or the account's
    currency). Although the Crédit Mutuel website displays number in
    continental format (i.e. with a coma as decimal separator), amount()
    returns a real number.

  as_string($separator)
    Returns a tab-delimited representation of the statement. By default, it
    uses a tabulation to separate the fields, but the user can provide its
    own separator.
